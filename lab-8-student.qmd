For this week's lab, we will be revisiting questions from previous lab
assignments, with the purpose of using functions from the `map()` family to 
iterate over certain tasks. To do this, we will need to load in the data from 
Lab 2, Lab 3, and Lab 7. I've included **all** three datasets in the `data`
folder, so all you need to do is read them in. 🙃 

```{r}
#| label: read-in-old-data

# Data from Lab 2
surveys <- read_csv(here::here("data", "surveys.csv"))

# Data from Lab 3
evals <- read_csv(here::here("data", "teacher_evals.csv")) |> 
  rename(sex = gender)

# Data from Lab 7
fish <- read_csv(here::here("data", "BlackfootFish.csv"))
```

## Lab 2

First up, we're going to revisit Question 3 from Lab 2. This question asked:

> What are the data types of the variables in this dataset?

**1. Using `map_chr()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the data type of each variable in the `surveys` dataset.** Specifically, the table should have 15 columns, one for
each variable, with the datatype of that variable immediately below it's name. 

```{r}
#| label: map-data-types-of-surveys


```

## Lab 3

Now, were on to Lab 3 where we will revisit two questions. 

In the original version of Lab 3, Question 5 asked you to:

> Change data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID
> really a numeric data type?)

**2. Using `map_at()`, convert the `teacher_id`, `weekday`, `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `gender` columns to factors.** Hint: You will need to use `bind_cols()` to transform the 
list output back into a data frame. 

```{r}
#| label: map-to-mutate-columns


```

Next up, we're going revisit Question 7 which asked:
> What are the demographics of the instructors in this study? Investigate the
> variables `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `sex` and summarize your
> findings in ~3 complete sentences.

Many people created **multiple** tables of counts for each of these
demographics, but in this exercise we are going to create **one** table with 
every demographic.

**3. Using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, recreate the table below.**

I'm using the `sen_level` classification from Challenge 3

- `"junior"` = `seniority` is 4 or less (inclusive)
- `"senior"` = `seniority` is more than 4

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are interested in exploring my table fomatting, I specifically used the 
`kable()` function from the **knitr** package to first get an HTML table. Then
I styled that table using the `kable_styling()` function from the **kableExtra**
package.

## Lab 7

For our last problem, we will revisit a question from the most recent lab. 
Question 1 asked you to use `across()` to make a table which summarized: 

> What variable(s) have missing values present?  
> How many observations have missing values?

**4. Using `map_int()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the number of missing values for each variable in the `fish` data.** 

```{r}
#| label: map-missing-values-of-fish


```
